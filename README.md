# R6SExternalHack

This is probably detected but can be used to learn... maybe :)

R6S external hack with window Hijacking to draw without ImGUI.
This is a external client, he use NoBastian (NoBastian is a dll injected into lsass.exe used to pipe with client to read / write memory of R6S process) and hijack the notepadd window (can be change by another one) and draw on notepadd window.
